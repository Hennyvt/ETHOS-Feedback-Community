Firmware version 1.0.10, FCC. Using X20S
In the model menu , under Special function ACTION, Play Track, Enable, SF,arrow down, Unable to add the required audio track.
Have copied several audio tracks as used on my Horus X10S Express, but audio files still not visable in the Special function setup menu.
Trying to program an announcment using special function such as "Motors Armed" is not possible.
If I go to sys menu and enter File Manager click on Audio, select EN I can play the audio track but am unable to program the playback in Special Function.
